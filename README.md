# Lectures on Solar magnetic fields: diagnostics and applications
3rd SOLARNET School on "Solar Magnetic Fields: Modeling and Measuring Techniques", 18-23 May 2015, Granada, Spain

These repository contains the slides and codes that are part of the lecture.

## Slides
The slides are provided in Powerpoint format. The final version will be transformed to pdf.

## Codes
All programs are coded in Python. They need the following dependencies so you need to have them
installed in your system in case you want to use them:

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

## Data
We will be using some observations during the lectures. You can [download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ukawbdb7w75g5u0/AAA1I-xwr_-mVZ_5mE50a32Na?dl=0) them before
the lectures so that we can all play together with them.
